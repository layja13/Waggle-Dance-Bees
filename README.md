# Waggle-Dance-Bees
This work proposes designing an Agent-based Model that simulates the Waggle Dance, aiming to investigate how private information factors, specifically the memory of recently visited food sources, their quality, and foraging experience, along with the quality food source indicated in the waggle dance, can impact bees' decision to ignore it.
